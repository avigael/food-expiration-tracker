# Food Expiration Tracker

I wanted to build a food expiration tracker with a minimalistic user interface so I created this project. For now you can add, edit, and delete food and switch between dark mode and light mode. You can also set a threshold for when you wish to be warned about an expiring item. The app is built with React Native and Redux.

## Preview

## Improvements

I would like to add several features that vary in difficult. These include push notifications for items expiring soon, matching system theme automatically (dark mode/light mode), and adding a scanning mode that pulls data from a database a fill the name of a given entry automatically.

## How to install
